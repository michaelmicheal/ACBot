## Using ACBot to Schedule Fitness
To schedule fitness you need to configure date/time constants and run the fitness.py file more than 1 minute before you want to schedule a fitness slot. The program will login to LaurierAthletics.com 1 minute before the time you want it to schedule your fitness slot. Then at the time you specify it should schedule your slot, it will refresh, find the slot, reserve it, and sign the waivers. To configure and run ACBot to schedule fitness,
1. Open the 'constants.py' file and update the date constants
    ```{python}
    # Change this to be the date/time you want to work out
    FITNESS_DATE_TIME = dt.datetime(year = 2020, month= 12, day = 1, hour = 9)

    # Change this to be the date/time you want AC Bot to book at
    SCHEDULE_DATE_TIME = dt.datetime(year = 2020, month = 11, day = 27, hour = 12)
    ```

2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory
3. Run `python fitness.py`
